add-in crashes but PC version does not
- happens with Forth but also dummy apps like text editor
- added screen output statements to add-in and crashed after add_object 6
  - ie made it through all statements before crashing
- showed what looks like gint error screen
  - 040 TLB miss (nonexisting address) on read
  - PC:     0030b84a    (Error location)
  - TEA:    18710c7a    (Offending address)
  - TRA:    0x0         (Trap number)
- looked at disassembly but 30b84a is in start2.isra section
  - isra is some kind of optimized section but can't tell how it works
- redid debugging routines and now makes it through add_object 4 before returning to dummy 3
  - same nice error message
- PC is 0030b772 this time showing same instruction as 0030b84a above: mov.w   @(r0,r1),r1
- noted before here same calls to draw_rect, draw_modifier, draw_titles, then loading address of manager_colors
- draw_titles only called twice in whole project
- must be draw_manager which calls all of those in that order then loads manager_colors
  - added debugging
- strange - only does draw_manager once at beginning before pressing key to select program then crashing 
  - both calculator and PC
- this time, CG50 has add_object 1-4, 6 but skips 5
- error at 30d034 - same instruction indexing into manager_colors as above
- call to debug_global is there but but no screen output before crash
- added getkey to debug messages
- selected_window debug value is now 2350907523 (0x8C200083) rather than 0 or 1 as expected
  - 0x8C200000 is base address of heap!
  - no obvious way for this to happen
- see add_object calls and why 5 is skipped
- disabled exception handling code I had added which was hiding alignment error!
  - tried to read 0x8C20008A at 303894 between debug messages add_object 3 and 4
- alignment error was in ObjectInfo so added alignas
  - SOLVED
