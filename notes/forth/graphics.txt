images for games
- need some way to get graphics into source
- should work with graphics editor
  - graphics editor should be in forth
- graphics as text (ie hex values in Forth source) should be possible but is too inefficient for lots of graphics
- problem is Forth system shouldn't have much access to file system
  - maybe INCLUDE keyword to embed file into dictionary memory
  - reading from memory but not writing is good compromise
