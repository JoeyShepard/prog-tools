source of words held in RAM
- easy to edit
- compile when needed
- save words in RAM to file
- can reference word that hasn't been defined yet
  - redefining word replaces existing word rather than creating new version
  - existing references to the word now point to the new word
  - if referenced word hasn't been defined yet, create empty word in memory and mark as
    undefined. replace empty definition if word is defined.
    - no need to resolve all references at compile time. empty word throws error if executed
    - maybe word isn't empty but instead has code to throw error
  - each word assigned ID when encountered. same ID stays until next reload
  - tick fetches ID and EXECUTE accepts ID

CREATE
- if saving words then also need to save result of CREATE?
  - no, this is appealing but not possible since in addition to , would also need to save the
    calculations that led to the value laid down by ,
