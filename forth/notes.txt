combined/
- started to create combined primitives then stopped - not enough flash
- keeping for now since has list of primitives

machine-code/
- generate machine code instead
- note, checked disassembly of whole project and GBR not used for anything
  - https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/SH-Built-in-Functions.html
    - GCC doesnt really use GBR except for threads

CONCLUSION
- clear now that doesn't make sense to do a lot of these on calculator
  - sorting and rearranging especially can be avoided
- can probably get most of the benefit from a subset
  - model stack ops and initial
  - keep track of last item processed to see if can combine with current
    - like terms need to be contiguous
  - identities - *0,+0,*1,and,or,xor
  - rest of benefit not from optimizing
    - load constants with #imm addressing
    - GBR for temps and locals
    - assign registers
